# Thoughts on User Functionality

One option is to use blockchain to use a decentralized control scheme. This kind of system could be useful if we're charging access to data. It would be an alternative to requiring API keys, etc. An account balance can be maintained and refilled as desired, and allowed addresses (public keys) can be added by the user. Then instead of an API key, requests can just be signed using one of the addresses.
